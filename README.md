## Svelte Starter

This website is based on [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool)'s [starter template](https://github.com/the-pudding/svelte-starter) that aims to quickly scaffold a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) project, designed around data-driven, visual stories. Thanks for making this starter-kit public!
